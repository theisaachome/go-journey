## General Study Tips & Habits for Success

* **Daily Review:** Quickly recap previous day's learning before starting new material.
* **Active Recall:** Don't just consume; try to explain concepts, implement from memory, or teach others.
* **Code Every Day:** Consistency builds muscle memory.
* **Version Control (Git):** Use Git from day one and push regularly to GitHub â€“ it's your portfolio!
* **Debugging Skills:** Learn to use Go's debugger (`dlv` or IDE integrations) effectively.
* **Read Other People's Go Code:** Explore open-source projects to learn idiomatic Go.
* **Join the Go Community:** Engage on Reddit (r/golang), Slack/Discord channels, and local meetups in Ho Chi Minh City.
* **Mock Interviews:** Practice technical interviews once you feel confident.
* **Refactor Regularly:** Revisit old code to apply new knowledge and improve its quality.
